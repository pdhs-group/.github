# Particle Dynamics in Heterogeneous Systems
## Research Group at KIT

Particles shape our world and everyday life: Macroscopic material and product properties are determined by interactions and processes at the microscopic level.

Our goal is to answer pressing questions about such agglomeration and breakage phenomena, especially when multiple materials come together. Understanding the dynamics of these heterogeneous interfaces is essential for optimizing manufacturing processes, improving material properties, and driving innovation in areas such as energy storage.

To achieve this, we emphasize the synergy between theoretical modeling and hands-on experimentation.
